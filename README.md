# Test Server
 Additional test server for my Angular-Bootstrap Test project.

## What does it do?

It's necessary server for my other project's form data storage in MongoDB.

You need to make a new MongoDB database and make neccessary changes in the code for your own database.

To connect your database, you should create a `.env` file inside the folder and put this line inside it.

`DB_URL = YOUR URL`
